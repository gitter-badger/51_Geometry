\PMlinkescapeword{normal}

The perpendicular or normal line of a plane is a special case of the surface normal, but may be defined separately as follows:

A line $l$ is a {\em normal of a plane} $\pi$, if it intersects the plane and is perpendicular to all lines passing through the intersection point in the plane.\, Then the plane $\pi$ is a {\em normal plane} of the line $l$.\, The normal plane passing through the \PMlinkname{midpoint}{Midpoint3} of a line segment is the {\em center normal plane} of the segment.\\

There is the

\textbf{Theorem.}\, If a line ($l$) \PMlinkescapetext{cuts} a plane ($\pi$) and is perpendicular to two distinct lines ($m$ and $n$) passing through the cutting point ($L$) in the plane, then the line is a normal of the plane.

{\em Proof.}\, Let $a$ be an arbitrary line passing through the point $L$ in the plane $\pi$.\, We need to show that\, $a \perp l$.\; Set another line of the plane cutting the lines $m$, $n$ and $a$ at the points $M$, $N$ and $A$, respectively.\, Separate from $l$ the equally \PMlinkescapetext{long line} segments $LP$ and $LQ$.\, Then
$$PM \;=\; QM \quad \mbox{and} \quad PN \;=\; QN,$$
since any point of the center normal of a line segment ($PQ$) is equidistant from the end points of the segment.\, Consequently, 
$$\Delta MNP \cong \Delta MNQ \quad(\mbox{SSS}).$$
Thus the segments $PA$ and $QA$, being corresponding parts of two congruent triangles, are equally long.\, I.e., the point $A$ is equidistant from the end points of the segment $PQ$, and it must be on the \PMlinkname{perpendicular bisector}{CenterNormal} of $PQ$.\, Therefore\, $AL \bot PQ$, i.e.\, $a \bot l$.\\


\textbf{Proposition 1.}\, All \PMlinkescapetext{normals} of a plane are parallel.\, If a line is parallel to a normal of a plane, then it is a normal of the plane, too.


\textbf{Proposition 2.}\, All normal planes of a line are parallel.\, If a plane is parallel to a normal plane of a line, then also it is a normal plane of the line.
