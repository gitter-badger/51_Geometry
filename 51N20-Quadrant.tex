\begin{document}
The $x$- and $y$-axes \PMlinkescapetext{divide} the $xy$-plane in four right-angle domains which are called the {\em quadrants} of the plane. \,They are numbered going round the origin in anticlockwise direction so  that
$$\{(x,\,y) \mid \;  x > 0,\; y > 0\}$$
is the {\em first quadrant}, 
$$\{(x,\,y) \mid \;  x < 0,\; y > 0\}$$
the {\em second quadrant}, and so on. 

Naturally, one can speak of the quadrants of the complex plane, too.\\

The lines $y = \pm x$ have as their slope angles $\pm 45^\circ$,  
thus halving the quadrant angles; they are called the 
{\it quadrant bisectors}.\, Cf. angle bisector as locus.
