\begin{document}
A \ti{partial linear space} is a pair $(P,L)$ consisting of a set $P$ of points  and a set $L$ of lines such that
\begin{itemize}
\item every line \textrm{contains} at least two points, and
\item any two distinct points are on at most one line.
\end{itemize}
If, in \textrm{addition}, any two distinct points are on at least one line, then $(P,L)$ is called a \textit{linear space}.
