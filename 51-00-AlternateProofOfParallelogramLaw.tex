Proof of this is simple, given the cosine law:
\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos\phi
\]
where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, and angle $\phi$ is the corner angle opposite the side of length $c$.


Let us define the largest interior angles as angle $\theta$.
Applying this to the parallelogram, we find that
\begin{eqnarray*}
d_1^2 &=& u^2 + v^2 - 2uv\cos\theta\\
d_2^2 &=& u^2+v^2 - 2uv\cos\left(\pi-\theta\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
 


Knowing that
\[
\cos\left(\pi-\theta\right) = - \cos\theta
\]
we can add the two expressions together, and find ourselves with
\begin{eqnarray*}
d_1^2+d_2^2 &=& 2u^2 + 2v^2 - 2uv\cos\theta + 2uv\cos\theta\\
d_1^2+d_2^2 &=& 2u^2 + 2v^2
\end{eqnarray*}
which is the theorem we set out to prove.
