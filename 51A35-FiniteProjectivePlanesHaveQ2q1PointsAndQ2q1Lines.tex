{\bf Given} a finite projective plane that contains a quadrangle OXYZ (i.e.\ no
three of these four points are on one line). {\bf To prove}: the plane has
$q^2+q+1$ points and $q^2+q+1$ lines for some integer $q$, and there are $q+1$
points on each line and $q+1$ lines through each point.

Let $x$ and $y$ be the lines OX and
OY, which must exist by the axioms. By the assumption OXYZ is a quadrangle
these lines are distinct and Z is not on them. Let there be $p$ points X$_i$ on
$x$ other than O, for each of them one line ZX$_i$ exists, and is distinct
(one lines cannot pass through two X$_i$ unless it is $x$ but that's not a
line through Z). Conversely every line through Z must intersect $x$ in a
unique point (two lines intersecting in Z cannot intersect at another point,
and Z is not a point on $x$). So there are $p+1$ lines through Z (OZ is one
of them). By the same reasoning, using $y$, there are $q+1$ lines through Z
so $p=q$. We also found $q+1$ points (including O) on $y$ and the same number
on $x$. Intersecting the $q+1$ lines through Z with XY (on which Z does not
lie, the quadrangle again) reveals at least $q+1$ distinct points there and
at most $q+1$ because for each point there there is a line through it and Z.

The lines not through O intersect $x$ in one of the $q$ points X$_i$ and $y$
in one of the $q$ points Y$_j$. There are $q^2$ possibilities and each of them
is a distinct line, because there is only one line through a given X$_i$ and
Y$_j$. The lines that do pass through O intersect XY in one of the $q+1$
points there, again one line for each such point and vice versa. That's $q+1$
lines through O and $q^2$ not through O, $q^2+q+1$ in all.

There are $q+1$ lines through X (to each of the points of $y$) and $q+1$
lines through Y (to each of the points of $x$). Intersect the $q$ lines
through X other than XY with the $q$ lines through Y other than XY, these
$q^2$ intersections are all distinct because for any P there's only one line
PX and one line PY. Note we did not use the line XY. Conversely for any P not
on XY there must be some PX and some PY, so there are exactly $q^2$ points not
on XY. Add the $q+1$ points on XY for a total of $q^2+q+1$.

The constructions above already showed $q+1$ lines through some points (X, Y
and Z), by the same games as before that implies for each of them $q+1$ points
on every line not through that point. We also saw $q+1$ points on some lines
($x$, $y$, XY) which implies for each of them $q+1$ lines through every point
not on that line. Such reasoning covers $q^2$ items on first application and
rapidly mops up stragglers on repeated application.

Some form of this proof is standard math lore; this version was half remembered and half reconstructed.
