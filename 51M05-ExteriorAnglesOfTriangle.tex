The exterior angle of an angle of triangle is greater than both other 
angles of the triangle.

{\it Proof.}\, Let us study in an arbitrary triangle $ABC$ for example the exterior angle $\wedge ACD$ where $D$ is point on the lengthening of the side  $BC$ nearer to $C$ than to $B$.\, Let $E$ be the midpoint of $AC$.\, Let $BE$ be the median of the triangle.\, We find on its lengthening the point $F$ such that\, $EF = EB$.\, Then the triangles $ABE$ and $CEF$ are congruent (SAS).\, Consequently, we have\; 
$\wedge ECF \;=\;\, \wedge BAE$\;
and therefore\; $\wedge ACD \;>\; \wedge BAC$.\;\, Analogically one shows that\; 
$\wedge ACD \;>\; \wedge ABC$.\;\; $\Box$
