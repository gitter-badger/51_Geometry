\textbf{Theorem 1.}\, If a plane ($\pi$) intersects two parallel planes ($\varrho$, $\sigma$), the intersection lines are parallel.

{\em Proof.}\, The intersection lines cannot have common points, because $\varrho$ and $\sigma$ have no such ones.\, Since the lines are in a same plane $\pi$, they are parallel.\\


\textbf{Theorem 2.}\, If a plane ($\pi$) contains the \PMlinkname{normal}{PlaneNormal} ($n$) of another plane ($\varrho$), the planes are \PMlinkname{perpendicular}{DihedralAngle} to each other.

{\em Proof.}\, Draw in the plane $\varrho$ the line $l$ cutting the intersection line perpendicularly and cutting also $n$.\, Then $l$ must be perpendicular to $n$ and thus to the whole plane $\pi$ (see the Theorem in the entry normal of plane).\, Consequently, the right angle formed by the lines $n$ and $l$ is the normal section of the dihedral angle formed by the planes $\pi$ and $\varrho$.\, Therefore,\, $\pi \bot \varrho$.
