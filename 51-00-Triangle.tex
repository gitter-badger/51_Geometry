A \emph{triangle} is a \PMlinkescapetext{bounded} planar region delimited by three \PMlinkescapetext{straight} lines, i.e. it is a polygon with three angles.

In Euclidean geometry, the angle sum of a triangle is always equal to $180^\circ$. In the figure: $A+B+C=180^\circ$.

In hyperbolic geometry, the angle sum of a triangle is always strictly positive and strictly less than $180^\circ$.  In the figure: $0^\circ<A+B+C<180^\circ$.

In spherical geometry, the angle sum of a triangle is always strictly greater than $180^\circ$ and strictly less than $540^\circ$.  In the figure:  $180^\circ<A+B+C<540^\circ$.

Also in spherical geometry, a triangle has these additional requirements:  It must be strictly contained in a hemisphere of the sphere that is serving as the model for spherical geometry, and all of its angles must have a measure strictly less that $180^{\circ}$.

Triangles can be classified according to the number of their equal sides. So, a triangle with 3 equal sides is called \PMlinkname{\emph{equilateral}}{RegularTriangle}, a triangle with 2 equal sides is called \emph{isosceles}, and finally a triangle with no equal sides is called \emph{scalene}. Notice that an \PMlinkescapetext{equilateral triangle} is also isosceles, but there are isosceles triangles that are not equilateral.

In Euclidean geometry, triangles can also be classified according to the \PMlinkescapetext{size} of the greatest of its three (inner) angles. If the greatest of these is acute (and therefore all three are acute), the triangle is called an \emph{acute triangle}. If the triangle has a right angle, it is a \emph{right triangle}. If the triangle has an obtuse angle, it is an \emph{obtuse triangle}.

\subsubsection*{Area of a triangle}
There are several ways to \PMlinkescapetext{calculate} a triangle's area.

In hyperbolic and spherical \PMlinkescapetext{geometry}, the area of a triangle is equal to its defect (measured in radians).

For the rest of this entry, only Euclidean geometry will be 
considered.

Many \PMlinkescapetext{formulas} for the area of a triangle exist.  The most basic one is $\displaystyle A=\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is its base and $h$ is its height.  Following is a \PMlinkescapetext{derivation} of another \PMlinkescapetext{formula} for the area of a triangle.
 
Let $a,b,c$ be the sides and $A,B,C$ the interior angles \PMlinkescapetext{opposite} to them. Let $h_a,h_b,h_c $ be the heights drawn upon $a,b,c$ respectively, $r$ the inradius and $R$ the circumradius. Finally, let $\displaystyle s=\frac{a+b+c}{2}$ be the semiperimeter. Then

\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{Area} &=& \frac{a h_a}{2}=\frac{b h_b}{2}=\frac{c h_c}{2}\\
&=& \frac{ab\sin C}{2}=\frac{bc\sin A}{2}=\frac{ca\sin B}{2}\\
&=& \frac{abc}{4R}\\
&=& sr\\
&=& \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\end{eqnarray*}
The last \PMlinkescapetext{formula} is known as Heron's formula.

With the coordinates of the vertices \,$(x_1,\,y_1)$,\, $(x_2,\,y_2)$,\, $(x_3,\,y_3)$\, of the triangle, the area may be expressed as
$$ 
\pm\frac{1}{2}\left|\begin{matrix}
x_1 & y_1 & 1\\
x_2 & y_2 & 1\\
x_3 & y_3 & 1
\end{matrix}\right|
$$
(cf. the volume of \PMlinkname{tetrahedron}{Tetrahedron}).

Inequalities for the area are Weizenbock's inequality and the Hadwiger-Finsler inequality.
