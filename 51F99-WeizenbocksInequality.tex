In a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, $c$, and with area $A$, the following inequality holds:

$$ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \geq 4A \sqrt{3}$$
The proof goes like this: if $s=\frac{a+b+c}{2}$ is the semiperimeter of the
triangle, then from Heron's formula we have:
$$ A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} $$
But by squaring the latter and expanding the parentheses we obtain:
$$ 16A^2 = 2(a^2 b^2 + a^2 c^2 + b^2 c^2) - (a^4 + b^4 + c^4) $$
Thus, we only have to prove that:
$$ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 \geq 3[2(a^2 b^2 + a^2 c^2 + b^2 c^2) - (a^4 + b^4 +
c^4)] $$ or equivalently:
$$ 4(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) \geq 4(a^2 b^2 + a^2 c^2 + b^2 c^2)$$
which is trivially equivalent to:
$$ (a^2 - b^2)^2 + (a^2 - c^2)^2 + (b^2 - c^2)^2 \geq 0$$
Equality is achieved if and only if $a=b=c$ (i.e. when the triangle is equilateral) .

See also the Hadwiger-Finsler inequality, from which this result follows as a corollary.
