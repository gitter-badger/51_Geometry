\begin{itemize}
\item If the point $X$ is on the line segment $AB$ and\, $XA\!:\!XB = p\!:\!q$,\, then $X$ divides $AB$ {\em internally} in the ratio $p\!:\!q$.
\item If the point $Y$ is on the extension of line segment $AB$ and\, $YA\!:\!YB = p\!:\!q$,\, then $Y$ divides $AB$ {\em externally} in the ratio $p\!:\!q$.
\item If $p\!:\!q$ is the same in both cases, then the points $X$ and $Y$ divide $AB$ {\em harmonically} in the ratio $p\!:\!q$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Theorem 1.}  The bisectors of an angle of a triangle and its linear pair divide the opposite side of the triangle harmonically in the ratio of the adjacent sides.

\textbf{Theorem 2.}  If the points $X$ and $Y$ divide the line segment $AB$ harmonically in the ratio $p\!:\!q$, then the circle with diameter the segment $XY$ (the so-called Apollonius' circle) is the locus of such points whose distances from $A$ and $B$ have the ratio $p\!:\!q$.

The latter theorem may be proved by using analytic geometry.
