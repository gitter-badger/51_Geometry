Given the function $y = \tan^{-1}(x)$,

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{AsympArcTan}

we see that it has two asymptotes, namely $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $-(\frac{\pi}{2})$. This specific example of an asymptote was mentioned in an episode of the comedy TV show {\it The Big Bang Theory}, in which the mathematician Sheldon Eppes tries to explain his inability to reach the top of a rock wall, getting stuck at the same height each time. According to the Mathematica manual, the results of \verb=ArcTan= for real $z$ "are always in the range $- \pi / 2$ to $\pi / 2$.
