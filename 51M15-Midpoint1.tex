\PMlinkescapeword{degree}
The concept of \PMlinkname{midpoint of line segment}{Midpoint} is a special case of the midpoint of a curve or arbitrary figure in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$.

A point $T$ is a {\em midpoint} of the figure $f$, if for each point $A$ of $f$ there is a point $B$ of $f$ such that $T$ is the midpoint of the line segment $AB$.\, One says also that $f$ is symmetric about the point $T$.\\


Given the equation of a curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or of a surface $f$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, one can, if \PMlinkescapetext{necessary}, take a new point $T$ for the origin by using the linear substitutions of the form
$$x \;:=\; x'\!+\!a, \qquad y \;:=\; y'\!+\!b \quad \mbox{etc.}$$
Thus one may test whether the origin is the midpoint of $f$ by checking whether $f$ always contains along with any point\, $(x,\,y,\,z)$\, also the point\, $(-x,\,-y,\,-z)$.\\

It is easily verified the

\textbf{Theorem.}\, If the origin is the midpoint of a quadratic curve or a quadratic surface, then its equation has no \PMlinkname{terms of degree}{BasicPolynomial} 1.\\

Similarly one can verify the generalisation, that if the origin is the midpoint of an algebraic curve or surface of degree $n$, the equation has no terms of degree $n\!-\!1$,\, $n\!-\!3$\, and so on.\\

\textbf{Note.}\, Some curves and surfaces have infinitely many midpoints (see \PMlinkname{quadratic surfaces}{QuadraticSurfaces}).
