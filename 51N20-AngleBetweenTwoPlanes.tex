\begin{document}
Let $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ be two planes in the three-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$.\, The angle $\theta$ between these planes is defined by means of the normal vectors $\boldsymbol{n}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{n}_2$ of $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ through the relationship
$$\cos\theta = \Big| \frac{\langle \boldsymbol{n}_1,\boldsymbol{n}_2\rangle }{\| \boldsymbol{n}_1 \| \| \boldsymbol{n}_2 \|}\Big|,$$
where the numerator is the inner product of $\boldsymbol{n}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{n}_2$ and the denominator is product of the lengths of $\boldsymbol{n}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{n}_2$.\, The formula implies that the angle $\theta$ satisfies
$$0 \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}.$$

The quotient in the formula remains unchanged as one multiplies the normal vectors by some non-zero real numbers, so that the cosine is independent of the lengths of the chosen vectors.\, Therefore, there is no ambiguity in this definition.

\textbf{Generalization}.\, The above definition can be generalized, at least locally, to a pair of intersecting differentiable surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$.\, Given two differentiable surfaces $S_1$ and $S_2$ and a point $p\in S_1\cap S_2$, the angle between $S_1$ and $S_2$ at $p$ is defined to be the angle between the tangent planes $T_p(S_1)$ and $T_p(S_2)$.
