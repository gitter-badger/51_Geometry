(this proof is not correct yet)
\begin{thm} In an ordered geometry a line segment has at most one midpoint.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Let $[p,q]$ be a closed line segment and suppose $m$ and $m'$ are midpoints.
If $m:p:q$ then $[m,p] < [m,q]$ so $m$ is not a midpoint. Similarly we cannot have
$p:q:m$, so we have $p:m:q$. And also, $p:m':q$. Suppose $m \not = m'$. Without loss of
generality we can assume $p:m:m'$ and $m:m':q$. But then $[p,m'] > [p,m] \cong [m,q] > [m',q]$ so that
$[p,m'] \not \cong [m',q]$, a contradiction. Hence $m = m'$.
\end{proof}
