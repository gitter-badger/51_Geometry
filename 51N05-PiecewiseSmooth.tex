\begin{document}
A curve $\alpha : [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is said to be \textbf{piecewise smooth} if each component $\alpha_{1}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}$ of $\alpha$ has a bounded derivative $\alpha_{i}' \quad (i = 1, \ldots, n)$ which is continuous everywhere in $[a, b]$ except (possibly) at a finite number of points at which left- and right-sided  derivatives exist.

\begin{itemize}
\item Every piecewise smooth curve is rectifiable.

\item Every rectifiable curve can be approximated by piecewise smooth curves.
\end{itemize}
