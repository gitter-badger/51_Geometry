\begin{document}
A \emph{pencil} is a set of geometric objects, usually either congruent or
similar to each other, that share a common incidence property. Below are some of the most commonly encountered pencils:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A pencil of lines usually means a set of straight lines that are incident with one point.  If the lines all lie in the same plane, the pencil is sometimes called a \emph{flat pencil}.
\item In some cases, a pencil of lines denotes a set of parallel lines in a plane.  If a point of infinity is added to the plane, then we are back to the previous example.
\item A pencil of circles can mean that either these circles all intersect at exactly one point (or share the same tangent line)
\item A pencil of circles can also mean that the circles have two common points of intersection.
\end{enumerate}
