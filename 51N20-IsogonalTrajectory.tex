\begin{document}
Let a one-parametric family of plane curves \,$\gamma$\, have the differential equation
\begin{align}
F(x,\,y,\,\frac{dy}{dx}) \;=\; 0.
\end{align}
We want to determine the \emph{isogonal trajectories} of this family, i.e. the curves \,$\iota$\, intersecting all members of the family under a given angle, which is denoted by $\omega$.
For this purpose, we denote the slope angle of any curve $\gamma$ at such an intersection point by $\alpha$ and the slope angle of $\iota$ at the same point by $\beta$.\, Then
$$\beta-\alpha \;=\; \omega  \quad(\mbox{or alternatively\;\;} -\omega),$$
and accordingly
$$\frac{dy}{dx} \;=\; \tan\alpha \;=\; \frac{\tan\beta-\tan\omega}{1+\tan\beta\tan\omega} 
\;=\; \frac{y'-\tan\omega}{1+y'\tan\omega},$$
where $y'$ means the slope of $\iota$.\, Thus the equation
\begin{align}
F(x,\,y,\,\frac{y'-\tan\omega}{1+y'\tan\omega}) \;=\; 0
\end{align}
is satisfied by the derivative $y'$ of the ordinate of $\iota$.\, In other \PMlinkescapetext{words}, (2) is the differential equation of all isogonal trajectories of the given family of curves.\\

\textbf{Note.}\, In the special case \,$\omega = \frac{\pi}{2}$,\, it's a question of orthogonal trajectories.
