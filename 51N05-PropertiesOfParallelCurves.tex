\begin{document}
\begin{itemize}

\item Two plane curves are parallel curves of each other, if every normal of one curve is also a normal of the other curve (then one may show that the distance of the corresponding points of the curves is a \PMlinkescapetext{constant}).

\item Two curves are parallel curves of each other, if they are the loci of the end points of a line segment which moves perpendicularly to its own direction.

\item Every regular curve having a continuous curvature has an infinite family of parallel curves.

\item The parallelism of curves is an equivalence relation.

\item The two parallel curves $\gamma_{\pm a}$ on both sides of a curve $\gamma$ at the distance $a$ form the envelope of the family of circles with center on $\gamma$ and radius $a$.

\item If $\gamma$ is a \PMlinkescapetext{regular} and closed curve with perimeter $p$, then the perimeter of $\gamma_{\pm a}$ is equal to\, $p\pm 2\pi a$\, and the area between $\gamma$ and the parallel curve is equal to\,  
$pa\pm\pi a^2$ (one must also assume that the parallel curve don't intersect the evolute of $\gamma$).
