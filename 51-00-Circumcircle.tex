\begin{document}
For any triangle $ABC$ there is always
a circle passing through its three vertices.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{circumcircle}
\end{center}

Such circle is called a \emph{circumcircle}.
Its radius is the \emph{circumradius},
and its center is the \emph{circumcenter}.
The circumcenter lies at the intersection
of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle.

{\small
Since the perpendicular bisector of a segment
is the locus of points at the same distance from the segment endpoints,
the points on the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ are equidistant to $A$ and $B$.
The points in the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ are equidistant to $B$ and $C$,
and thus the intersection point $O$ is at the same distance from $A,B$ and $C$.}
\bigskip

In a more general setting, if $P$ is any polygon,
its circumcircle would be a circle passing through all vertices,
and circumradius and circumcenter are defined similarly.
However, unlike triangles, circumcircles need not to exist for any polygon.
For instance, a non-rectangular parallelogram has no circumcircle,
for no circle passes through the four vertices.
A quadrilateral that does possess a circumcircle
is called a cyclic quadrilateral.
