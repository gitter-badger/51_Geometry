The parallel postulate (in the form given in the \PMlinkname{parent entry}{ParallelPostulate}) allows to prove the important fact about the triangles in the Euclidean geometry:

\textbf{Theorem.}\, The sum of the interior angles of any triangle equals the straight angle.

{\it Proof.}\, Let $ABC$ be an arbitrary triangle with the interior angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$.\, In the plane of the triangle we set the lines $AD$ and $AE$ such that\, $\wedge BAD = \beta$\, and\, $\wedge CAE = \gamma$.\, Then the lines do not intersect the line $BC$.\, In fact, if e.g. $AD$ would intersect $BC$ in a point $P$, then there would exist a triangle $ABP$ where an \PMlinkname{exterior angle}{ExteriorAnglesOfTriangle} of an angle would equal to an interior angle of another angle which is impossible.\, Thus $AD$ and $AE$ are both parallel to $BC$.\, By the parallel postulate, these lines have to coincide.\, This means that the addition of the triangle angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ gives a straight angle.
