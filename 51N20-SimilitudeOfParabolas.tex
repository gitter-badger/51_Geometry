Two parabolas need not be congruent, but they are always similar.\, Without the definition of parabola by focus and directrix, the fact turns out of the simplest equation \,$y = ax^2$\, of parabola.

Let us take two parabolas
$$y \;=\; ax^2 \quad \mbox{and} \quad y \;=\; bx^2$$
which have the origin as common vertex and the $y$-axis as common axis.\, Cut the parabolas with the line \,$y = mx$\, through the vertex.\, The first parabola gives
$$ax^2 = mx,$$
whence the abscissa of the other point of intersection is $\frac{m}{a}$; the corresponding ordinate is thus
$\frac{m^2}{a}$.\, So, this point has the position vector
$$\vec{u} \;=\; \left(\!\begin{array}{c}\frac{m}{a}\\\frac{m^2}{a}\end{array}\!\right)
\;=\; \frac{m}{a}\left(\!\begin{array}{c}1\\m\end{array}\!\right)$$
Similarly, the cutting point of the line and the second parabola has the position vector
$$\vec{v} \;=\; \left(\!\begin{array}{c}\frac{m}{b}\\\frac{m^2}{b}\end{array}\!\right)
\;=\; \frac{m}{b}\left(\!\begin{array}{c}1\\m\end{array}\!\right)$$
Accordingly, those position vectors have the \PMlinkid{linear depencence}{848}
$$a\vec{u} \;=\; b\vec{v}$$
for all values of the slope $m$ of the cutting line.\, This means that both parabolas are homothetic with respect to the origin and therefore also similar.
