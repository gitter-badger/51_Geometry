\begin{document}
Consider a triangle $\triangle ABC$ in either \PMlinkname{hyperbolic or spherical geometry}{NonEuclideanGeometry} in which its angle sum in radians is $\Sigma$.

In hyperbolic geometry, the \emph{defect} of $\triangle ABC$ is $\delta(\triangle ABC)=\pi-\Sigma$.

In spherical geometry, the \emph{defect} of $\triangle ABC$ is $\delta(\triangle ABC)=\Sigma-\pi$.

Note that, in both hyperbolic and spherical geometry, the area of a \PMlinkescapetext{triangle} is equal to its defect.
