\begin{document}
Two points $P_1$ and $P_2$ on the circumference of a circle (or on a sphere) are {\em diametral}, if the line segment $P_1P_2$ connecting them passes through the centre of the circle (resp. the sphere), i.e. is a \PMlinkname{diametre}{Diameter}. Equivalently, the shortest distance of the diametral points $P_1$ and $P_2$ on the circle is maximal on the circle (resp. on the sphere), namely a half of the \PMlinkname{perimetre}{Perimeter}.

It's easily justified that a point of a circle (resp. a sphere) has exactly one diametral point.\\

A circle $c$ is a {\em diametral circle} of a given circle $c_0$, if $c$ intersects $c_0$ {\em diametrically}, i.e. in two diametral points of $c_0$.

If the equation of $c_0$ is\, $(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2 = r^2$\, and\, $(a,\,b)$\, is inside $c_0$, then the equation of the diametral circle $c$ with centre\, $(a,\,b)$\, is given by
$$(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2 = r^2-(x_0-a)^2-(y_0-b)^2.$$
