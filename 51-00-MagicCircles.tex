\begin{document}
Given $n$ circles which intersect $k$ times, the set of circles is referred to as \emph{magic circles} if there exists a numbering (using $\{1,\ldots,k\}$) of the intersections of the $n$ circles such that the sum of the numbers at the intersections along each circle is the same constant for all circles.
